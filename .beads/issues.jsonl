This task explores modifying BOTH ends - also adjusting the END of each chunk to better connect to the next.\n\n## Technical Background\n\nCurrent approach (unidirectional):\n```\nChunk N:   [.......prev_last]\nChunk N+1: [curr_first.......]\n            ↑ Only this is modified to approach prev_last\n```\n\nBidirectional approach:\n```\nChunk N:   [.......prev_last]  ← Also modify to approach predicted next value\nChunk N+1: [curr_first.......]  ← Modify to approach prev_last\n```\n\n## Implementation Challenge\n\nWe don't know `curr_first` of the next chunk until we receive it. Solutions:\n\n### Option A: One-chunk delay buffer\n- Buffer each chunk\n- When next chunk arrives, modify end of buffered chunk based on next chunk's start\n- Output the modified buffered chunk\n- Trade-off: Adds ~0.5s latency\n\n### Option B: Predictive fade\n- Fade the last N samples of each chunk toward zero or toward running average\n- Less accurate but no added latency\n```python\n# Fade end of chunk toward predicted continuation\nfade_samples = 32\nfade_curve = np.linspace(1.0, 0.8, fade_samples)  # Partial fade\naudio_f32[-fade_samples:] *= fade_curve\n```\n\n### Option C: Symmetric interpolation (both ends fade to/from midpoint)\n- Start of chunk: interpolate from prev_last to actual value\n- End of chunk: interpolate from actual value toward running average\n- Both use symmetric window functions\n\n## Implementation Location\n`scripts/audio_processor.py` in `create_processor()` function\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Add end-of-chunk processing\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1.

Latency measurement: Ensure TTFT impact is acceptable\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Improved audio quality over unidirectional approach\n- If using buffer approach, latency increase documented and acceptable\n- No audio artifacts introduced by end-of-chunk modification\n\n## Notes\n- This could be combined with start-of-chunk interpolation\n- Consider testing with and without start interpolation to isolate effect","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:52:29.657358-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.880708-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.880708-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

Write tests first, then implement.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Add fixed-gain normalization for streaming mode (+12 dB)\n- [ ] Add LUFS normalization for non-streaming/file mode (target -16 LUFS)\n- [ ] Make gain value configurable\n- [ ] Graceful handling of silence/very quiet audio\n- [ ] Add tests verifying normalized output levels","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-26T09:39:11.030426-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T10:14:38.596596-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T10:14:38.596596-08:00","close_reason":"Superseded by mlx-tts-w4b (dynamic compression).

{"id":"mlx-tts-7qw","title":"Implement adaptive interpolation window based on discontinuity magnitude","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nInstead of a fixed interpolation window, dynamically size the window based on how large the discontinuity is. Large jumps need more samples to smooth out; small jumps can use fewer.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\nCurrent approach uses fixed 20ms window regardless of discontinuity size:\n- 3% jump and 0.1% jump get same treatment\n- Small jumps may not need correction at all (wasted processing)\n- Large jumps may need longer correction window\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n```python\ndef calculate_adaptive_window(discontinuity, sample_rate, base_ms=20.0, max_ms=100.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scale window size based on discontinuity magnitude.\n    \n    Args:\n        discontinuity: Absolute difference between prev_last and curr_first\n        sample_rate: Audio sample rate\n        base_ms: Minimum window size\n        max_ms: Maximum window size\n    \"\"\"\n    # Discontinuity thresholds (percentage of full scale)\n    SMALL_DISC = 0.01   # 1% - minimal correction needed\n    LARGE_DISC = 0.05   # 5% - full correction window\n    \n    disc_abs = abs(discontinuity)\n    \n    if disc_abs \u003c SMALL_DISC:\n        # Small discontinuity - minimal or no correction\n        return int(sample_rate * base_ms / 1000)\n    elif disc_abs \u003e= LARGE_DISC:\n        # Large discontinuity - maximum window\n        return int(sample_rate * max_ms / 1000)\n    else:\n        # Linear interpolation between base and max\n        ratio = (disc_abs - SMALL_DISC) / (LARGE_DISC - SMALL_DISC)\n        ms = base_ms + ratio * (max_ms - base_ms)\n        return int(sample_rate * ms / 1000)\n```\n\n### Integration Point\nIn `audio_processor.py`, replace fixed `interp_samples` with dynamic calculation:\n```python\n# Before (current)\ninterp_samples = max(4, int(sample_rate * INTERP_MS / 1000))\n\n# After (adaptive)\ndisc = audio_f32[0] - state[\"prev_last\"]\ninterp_samples = calculate_adaptive_window(disc, sample_rate)\ninterp_curve = generate_curve(interp_samples)  # May need to cache common sizes\n```\n\n### Performance Consideration\nGenerating new curves for each chunk is expensive. Solution:\n- Pre-compute curves for common sizes (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100ms)\n- Round to nearest pre-computed size\n- Or use a formula that doesn't require pre-computation\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Add adaptive window logic\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Unit test: Verify window scaling function with known inputs\n2. Unit test: Small discontinuity → small window\n3. Unit test: Large discontinuity → large window\n4. Integration: Run diagnose_clipping.py to analyze actual discontinuity distribution\n5. Manual listening test\n\n```bash\n# Analyze discontinuity distribution in real audio\nuv run python scripts/diagnose_clipping.py --real \"Test text\" --verbose\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Crackles eliminated for typical discontinuity sizes\n- Processing overhead not significantly increased\n- No audible artifacts from variable window sizes","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:52:10.144-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.88021-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.88021-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"mlx-tts-9po","title":"Experiment with different interpolation curve shapes","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nCurrent implementation uses a raised cosine (cos²) curve for interpolation correction. Different curve shapes may produce more natural-sounding transitions.\n\n## Current Implementation\n```python\n# Raised cosine: cos²(0 to π/2) = 1.0 to 0.0\ninterp_curve = np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi / 2, interp_samples, dtype=np.float32)) ** 2\n```\n\nThis provides smooth start (derivative=0 at boundary) but may not be optimal for audio.\n\n## Curves to Test\n\n### 1. Linear\n```python\n# Simple linear ramp from 1 to 0\ncurve = np.linspace(1, 0, n_samples)\n```\nPros: Simple, predictable\nCons: Discontinuous derivative at boundaries\n\n### 2. Exponential decay\n```python\n# Exponential: e^(-t/tau) where tau controls decay rate\nt = np.linspace(0, 5, n_samples)  # 5 time constants\ncurve = np.exp(-t)\ncurve = curve / curve[0]  # Normalize to start at 1\n```\nPros: Natural decay, commonly used in audio\nCons: Never truly reaches zero\n\n### 3. Gaussian\n```python\n# Gaussian: e^(-t²/2σ²)\nt = np.linspace(0, 3, n_samples)  # 3 sigma\ncurve = np.exp(-t**2 / 2)\n```\nPros: Very smooth, used in audio windowing\nCons: May be too gradual\n\n### 4. Hann window (half)\n```python\n# Half Hann window: 0.5 * (1 + cos(π * t))\nt = np.linspace(0, 1, n_samples)\ncurve = 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(np.pi * t))\n```\nPros: Standard in audio processing, smooth derivatives\nCons: Similar to current raised cosine\n\n### 5. Blackman-Harris (half)\n```python\n# Half Blackman-Harris - excellent sidelobe suppression\nt = np.linspace(0, 0.5, n_samples)\na0, a1, a2, a3 = 0.35875, 0.48829, 0.14128, 0.01168\ncurve = a0 - a1*np.cos(2*np.pi*t) + a2*np.cos(4*np.pi*t) - a3*np.cos(6*np.pi*t)\ncurve = curve / curve[0]  # Normalize\n```\nPros: Minimizes spectral artifacts\nCons: More complex\n\n### 6. S-curve (sigmoid)\n```python\n# Inverted sigmoid for smooth 1→0 transition\nt = np.linspace(-6, 6, n_samples)\ncurve = 1 - 1/(1 + np.exp(-t))\n```\nPros: Very smooth, equal derivatives at both ends\nCons: Might smear more audio than necessary\n\n## Testing Approach\n\nCreate parameterized test:\n```python\nCURVES = {\n    \"raised_cosine\": lambda n: np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, n))**2,\n    \"linear\": lambda n: np.linspace(1, 0, n),\n    \"exponential\": lambda n: np.exp(-np.linspace(0, 5, n)),\n    \"hann\": lambda n: 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(np.pi * np.linspace(0, 1, n))),\n    # ... etc\n}\n\nfor name, curve_fn in CURVES.items():\n    # Generate speech with this curve\n    # Listen and rate quality\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Make curve configurable or test variations\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1.

Create `tests/test_mlx_tts.py` with pytest fixtures\n2. Write tests for model loading (mock mlx_audio imports)\n3. Write tests for audio generation with preloaded model\n4. Write tests for play=True behavior\n5. Run tests - all should FAIL (no implementation yet)\n\n### Phase 2: Core API Integration  \n**🟢 Green Phase** - Minimal implementation to pass tests\n1. Create `mlx_tts_core.py` module with:\n   - `load_tts_model()` - wraps load_model with error handling\n   - `generate_speech()` - wraps generate_audio with our defaults\n2. Update `tts-notify.py` to import and use new module\n3. Run tests - all should PASS\n\n### Phase 3: Refactor \u0026 Optimize\n**🔵 Refactor Phase** - Clean up without breaking tests\n1. Add model caching at module level\n2. Add lazy loading with `@functools.lru_cache`\n3. Add timeout handling for generation\n4. Run tests - all should still PASS\n\n## Key Code Changes\n\n**Before (subprocess):**\n```python\nsubprocess.run([\n    sys.executable, \"-m\", \"mlx_audio.tts.generate\",\n    \"--model\", MLX_MODEL,\n    \"--text\", message,\n    ...\n])\n```\n\n**After (direct API):**\n```python\nfrom mlx_audio.tts.utils import load_model\nfrom mlx_audio.tts.generate import generate_audio\n\n_model = None\n\ndef get_model():\n    global _model\n    if _model is None:\n        _model = load_model(\"mlx-community/chatterbox-turbo-fp16\")\n    return _model\n\ndef speak_mlx(message: str):\n    generate_audio(\n        text=message,\n        model=get_model(),\n        ref_audio=MLX_VOICE_REF,\n        ref_text=\".\",\n        speed=MLX_SPEED,\n        play=True,\n        verbose=False,\n    )\n```\n\n## Test Cases\n\n### Unit Tests\n```python\ndef test_load_tts_model_returns_valid_model():\n    model = load_tts_model()\n    assert hasattr(model, 'sample_rate')\n\ndef test_generate_speech_with_preloaded_model():\n    model = load_tts_model()\n    # Should not raise, should play audio\n    generate_speech(\"Test\", model=model, play=True)\n\ndef test_model_reuse_no_reload():\n    m1 = get_model()\n    m2 = get_model()\n    assert m1 is m2  # Same instance\n```\n\n### Integration Tests  \n```python\ndef test_warm_latency_under_1_second():\n    model = get_model()  # Cold load\n    start = time.time()\n    generate_speech(\"Quick test\", model=model, play=False)\n    assert time.time() - start \u003c 1.0\n```\n\n## Success Metrics\n- [ ] All unit tests pass\n- [ ] Warm latency \u003c1s\n- [ ] No subprocess calls for MLX TTS\n- [ ] Graceful fallback to macOS say on failure\n\n## Blocked By\n- mlx-tts-sqn (Research) ✅ COMPLETE","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-24T15:51:53.806082-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T16:51:18.190151-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-24T16:51:18.190151-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented direct mlx_audio API calls with model caching.

{"id":"mlx-tts-e95","title":"Epic: Fix streaming mode audio quality (eliminate crackles/clicks)","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nStreaming mode TTS produces audible crackles/clicks at chunk boundaries. Non-streaming mode produces perfect audio, confirming the root cause is discontinuities between streaming chunks.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe MLX Chatterbox model's streaming output (`stream=True` with `streaming_interval=0.5`) produces audio chunks that don't smoothly connect:\n\n```\nTransition 4-\u003e5: prev[-1]=0.00204, curr[0]=-0.03491, Jump=3.7%\nTransition 5-\u003e6: prev[-1]=0.00568, curr[0]=-0.03960, Jump=4.5%\n```\n\nThese 3-5% amplitude jumps cause audible clicks when chunks are stitched together.\n\n## Current State\n\n- 20ms raised-cosine interpolation in `audio_processor.py` helps but doesn't eliminate issue\n- Tested windows from 8 samples to 20ms - improvement but not resolution\n- Compressor/limiter not the cause (crackles present even when disabled)\n\n## Key Files\n\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Audio processing with interpolation fix\n- `scripts/mlx_tts_core.py` - Streaming generation in `_generate_streaming_with_metrics()`\n- `scripts/diagnose_clipping.py` - Diagnostic tool\n- `scripts/tts_config.py` - Configuration\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nStreaming mode audio should be indistinguishable from non-streaming mode - no audible artifacts at chunk boundaries while maintaining low TTFT (~0.2s).\n\n## Testing Approach\n\nAll child tasks MUST use `/tdd-cycle` skill. Test with:\n```bash\nuv run python -c \"\nimport sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts')\nfrom mlx_tts_core import generate_speech, get_model\ntest_text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

DC blocker operates on very low frequencies (~3-15Hz) which is irrelevant to click artifacts.\n\n### Recommended Solution\n**OLA with 20ms crossfade is the complete solution.**\n\nSignal chain: Raw chunks → OLA (20ms) → Compressor/Limiter → Output\n\nNo DC blocker needed.\n\n### Implementation Status\n- OLA implementation complete in audio_processor.py (create_ola_processor, create_processor_with_ola)\n- 25 unit tests passing\n- Ready for integration into streaming pipeline","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:50:07.061385-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2025-12-28T21:00:08.328648-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T21:00:08.328648-08:00","close_reason":"Resolved.

The sync actually completes successfully, but the final status check fails because beads tries to treat `.git` as a directory when it is a file in worktrees.\n\n## Environment\n- beads v0.42.0\n- Bare repo with worktrees (git worktree add)\n- macOS\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set up a bare repo with worktrees:\n   ```bash\n   git clone --bare \u003crepo\u003e .bare\n   echo \"gitdir: ./.bare\" \u003e .git\n   git worktree add main main\n   cd main\n   ```\n\n2. Initialize beads with sync branch:\n   ```bash\n   bd init --branch beads-sync\n   ```\n\n3. Run bd sync:\n   ```bash\n   bd sync\n   ```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nSync completes without error.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n```\n→ Re-exporting after import to sync DB changes...\nImport complete: no changes\nError: checking git status after re-export: git status failed: exit status 128\n```\n\n## Debug Output\n```\nBD_DEBUG=1 bd sync\n...\nfork protection: failed to update exclude: mkdir /path/to/main/.git: not a directory\n```\n\n## Root Cause\nIn worktrees, `.git` is a file containing `gitdir: \u003cpath\u003e`, not a directory. Beads is trying to `mkdir .git` which fails.\n\n## Workaround\nThe sync actually completes successfully - the error is cosmetic. Ignore the exit code.\n\n## Related Issues Fixed This Session\n- **Merge artifacts**: `bd doctor` found 4 temporary merge files (beads.base.jsonl, beads.base.meta.json, beads.left.jsonl, beads.left.meta.json) that persisted after sync operations. Fixed with `rm -f .beads/beads.*.jsonl .beads/beads.*.meta.json`\n- **Untracked JSONL files**: `bd doctor` warned about untracked `.beads/*.jsonl` files. Fixed by committing them to git.\n\n## Suggested Fix\nCheck if `.git` is a file (worktree) vs directory (regular repo) before attempting mkdir operations. Use `git rev-parse --git-dir` to get the actual git directory path.","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-31T13:57:43.029789-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2025-12-31T14:00:58.096606-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-31T14:00:58.096606-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"mlx-tts-lse","title":"Investigate mlx_audio AudioPlayer for buffer underrun issues","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nThe crackles might not only be from chunk discontinuities but also from buffer underruns in the AudioPlayer. When the player's buffer runs dry, it can cause clicks/pops as the audio stream stutters.\n\n## Investigation Areas\n\n### 1. Buffer Size Analysis\nCheck if AudioPlayer buffer is large enough:\n```python\nfrom mlx_audio.tts.audio_player import AudioPlayer\nimport inspect\n\n# Examine AudioPlayer implementation\nprint(inspect.getsource(AudioPlayer))\n```\n\nKey questions:\n- What's the default buffer size?\n- Is it configurable?\n- Does it auto-tune based on chunk delivery rate?\n\n### 2. Buffer State Monitoring\nAdd logging to monitor buffer fill level:\n```python\n# In mlx_tts_core.py streaming loop\nfor result in model.generate(...):\n    buffer_samples = player.buffered_samples()\n    print(f\"Buffer: {buffer_samples} samples ({buffer_samples/sample_rate*1000:.1f}ms)\")\n    player.queue_audio(audio_chunk)\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Buffer dropping to zero (underrun)\n- Large buffer fluctuations\n- Correlation between low buffer and crackles\n\n### 3. Timing Analysis\nCheck if chunk generation is fast enough:\n```python\nimport time\nfor result in model.generate(...):\n    now = time.perf_counter()\n    chunk_duration = len(result.audio) / sample_rate\n    time_since_last = now - last_time\n    \n    if time_since_last \u003e chunk_duration:\n        print(f\"WARNING: Generation slower than realtime! gap={time_since_last-chunk_duration:.3f}s\")\n    \n    last_time = now\n```\n\n### 4. AudioPlayer Source Review\nLocation of AudioPlayer in mlx_audio package:\n```bash\npython -c \"import mlx_audio.tts.audio_player as ap; print(ap.__file__)\"\n```\n\nReview for:\n- How it handles chunk concatenation internally\n- Buffer management strategy\n- Any known issues or TODOs\n\n## Potential Fixes (if buffer is the issue)\n\n### Option A: Increase buffer size\nIf AudioPlayer accepts buffer configuration, increase it.\n\n### Option B: Pre-buffer before starting\nWait for N chunks before starting playback:\n```python\nchunks_to_buffer = 3\nbuffered = []\nfor result in model.generate(...):\n    if len(buffered) \u003c chunks_to_buffer:\n        buffered.append(audio_processor(result.audio))\n    else:\n        if not player.playing:\n            for chunk in buffered:\n                player.queue_audio(chunk)\n            player.start_stream()\n        player.queue_audio(audio_processor(result.audio))\n```\n\n### Option C: Custom AudioPlayer\nIf mlx_audio's player is inflexible, implement custom using sounddevice or pyaudio.\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- `mlx_audio.tts.audio_player` - External package, read-only investigation\n- `scripts/mlx_tts_core.py` - Our usage of AudioPlayer\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Diagnostic: Log buffer levels during playback\n2. Diagnostic: Correlate buffer levels with audible crackles\n3. If fix identified: Before/after comparison\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Determine if buffer underrun is a contributing factor\n- If yes, implement fix that maintains low TTFT\n- Document AudioPlayer's behavior for future reference\n\n## Notes\n- This may reveal it's NOT a buffer issue, which is also valuable\n- Low RTF (\u003c 1.0) from our tests suggests generation is faster than realtime\n- But network/processing jitter could still cause momentary underruns","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:54:16.94948-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.882391-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.882391-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"mlx-tts-yx3","title":"Implement overlap-add synthesis for seamless chunk stitching","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nImplement overlap-add (OLA) synthesis - the standard DSP technique for artifact-free audio chunk processing. This is the most robust solution used in professional audio software.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Algorithm\n1. Each chunk gets windowed with a symmetric window (Hann recommended)\n2. Consecutive chunks overlap by 50%\n3. Overlapping regions are summed together\n4. The window function ensures smooth amplitude transitions\n\n### Implementation Location\n`scripts/audio_processor.py` - modify `create_processor()` function\n\n### Pseudocode\n```python\ndef overlap_add_processor(chunk_size, overlap_ratio=0.5):\n    hop_size = int(chunk_size * (1 - overlap_ratio))\n    window = np.hanning(chunk_size)\n    buffer = None\n    \n    def process(audio_chunk):\n        nonlocal buffer\n        # Window the input\n        windowed = audio_chunk * window\n        \n        if buffer is None:\n            buffer = windowed\n            return np.array([])  # Need more data\n        \n        # Overlap-add\n        output = buffer[:hop_size].copy()\n        buffer = np.zeros(chunk_size)\n        buffer[:len(windowed)] = windowed\n        # Add overlap region\n        # ... (handle variable chunk sizes)\n        \n        return output\n```\n\n### Challenges\n- Streaming chunks from MLX may have variable sizes\n- Need to handle first/last chunk edge cases\n- May need to buffer ~50% of a chunk before output (slight latency increase)\n- Must integrate with existing compressor/limiter pipeline\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Add OLA processing before or after interpolation\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Unit test: Verify OLA produces continuous output for known discontinuous input\n2. Unit test: Verify window function is correctly applied\n3. Integration test: Compare streaming vs non-streaming audio quality\n4. Manual listening test with long text\n\n```bash\n# Diagnostic command\nuv run python scripts/diagnose_clipping.py --real \"Long test text here\"\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- No audible clicks/crackles in streaming mode\n- TTFT remains under 0.5s\n- RTF (real-time factor) not significantly degraded\n\n## References\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap%E2%80%93add_method\n- Current interpolation code in audio_processor.py lines 50-68","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:50:56.061773-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.878678-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.878678-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
