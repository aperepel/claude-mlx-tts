Streaming Mode (Fixed Gain)\n\nFor streaming playback, apply **fixed +12 dB gain** per chunk:\n\n```python\nSTREAMING_GAIN_DB = 12.0\ngain_linear = 10 ** (STREAMING_GAIN_DB / 20)  # ~4x\n\n# Per-chunk normalization (zero latency overhead)\nchunk_normalized = chunk * gain_linear\n```\n\nWhy fixed gain works:\n- Chatterbox output levels are **consistent** (same voice reference)\n- Peak at -11.4 dBFS leaves headroom → +12 dB wont clip\n- No per-chunk LUFS measurement needed → zero latency\n\n### 2. Non-Streaming Mode (LUFS)\n\nFor file output or non-streaming playback, use proper LUFS normalization:\n\n```python\nimport pyloudnorm as pyln\n\nTARGET_LUFS = -16.0\nmeter = pyln.Meter(samplerate)\nloudness = meter.integrated_loudness(data)\nif loudness \u003e -70:  # Avoid normalizing silence\n    data = pyln.normalize.loudness(data, loudness, TARGET_LUFS)\n```\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n⚠️ **Use `/tdd-cycle` skill** when implementing this feature. Write tests first, then implement.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Add fixed-gain normalization for streaming mode (+12 dB)\n- [ ] Add LUFS normalization for non-streaming/file mode (target -16 LUFS)\n- [ ] Make gain value configurable\n- [ ] Graceful handling of silence/very quiet audio\n- [ ] Add tests verifying normalized output levels","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-26T09:39:11.030426-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T10:14:38.596596-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T10:14:38.596596-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mlx-tts-31t","depends_on_id":"mlx-tts-r2h","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-26T09:57:20.705216-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Current 20ms window helps but doesn't fully resolve the issue.\n\n## Technical Background\n\nCurrent implementation in `scripts/audio_processor.py`:\n```python\nINTERP_MS = 20.0  # Currently set to 20ms\ninterp_samples = max(4, int(sample_rate * INTERP_MS / 1000))\ninterp_curve = np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi / 2, interp_samples, dtype=np.float32)) ** 2\n\n# In processor():\nif state[\"prev_last\"] is not None and len(audio_f32) \u003e= interp_samples:\n    disc = audio_f32[0] - state[\"prev_last\"]\n    audio_f32 = audio_f32.copy()\n    audio_f32[:interp_samples] -= disc * interp_curve\n```\n\nThe raised cosine curve smoothly interpolates from the discontinuity to zero correction over N samples.\n\n## Experiment Plan\n\nTest these window sizes:\n1. 50ms (~1200 samples at 24kHz)\n2. 75ms (~1800 samples)\n3. 100ms (~2400 samples)\n\nFor each:\n- Listen for crackles with long test text\n- Measure any perceptible audio quality degradation\n- Check if interpolation affects speech intelligibility\n\n## Implementation\n\nSimple change to `INTERP_MS` constant in `audio_processor.py`.\n\nFor testing, can also make it configurable:\n```python\nINTERP_MS = float(os.environ.get(\"TTS_INTERP_MS\", \"20.0\"))\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Change INTERP_MS constant\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Parameterized test with different window sizes\n2. Verify interpolation curve is correctly sized\n3. Manual A/B listening comparison\n\n```bash\n# Test with different window sizes\nTTS_INTERP_MS=50 uv run python -c \"\nimport sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts')\nfrom mlx_tts_core import generate_speech\ngenerate_speech('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The sync actually completes successfully, but the final status check fails because beads tries to treat `.git` as a directory when it is a file in worktrees.\n\n## Environment\n- beads v0.42.0\n- Bare repo with worktrees (git worktree add)\n- macOS\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set up a bare repo with worktrees:\n   ```bash\n   git clone --bare \u003crepo\u003e .bare\n   echo \"gitdir: ./.bare\" \u003e .git\n   git worktree add main main\n   cd main\n   ```\n\n2. Initialize beads with sync branch:\n   ```bash\n   bd init --branch beads-sync\n   ```\n\n3. Run bd sync:\n   ```bash\n   bd sync\n   ```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nSync completes without error.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n```\n→ Re-exporting after import to sync DB changes...\nImport complete: no changes\nError: checking git status after re-export: git status failed: exit status 128\n```\n\n## Debug Output\n```\nBD_DEBUG=1 bd sync\n...\nfork protection: failed to update exclude: mkdir /path/to/main/.git: not a directory\n```\n\n## Root Cause\nIn worktrees, `.git` is a file containing `gitdir: \u003cpath\u003e`, not a directory. Beads is trying to `mkdir .git` which fails.\n\n## Workaround\nThe sync actually completes successfully - the error is cosmetic. Ignore the exit code.\n\n## Related Issues Fixed This Session\n- **Merge artifacts**: `bd doctor` found 4 temporary merge files (beads.base.jsonl, beads.base.meta.json, beads.left.jsonl, beads.left.meta.json) that persisted after sync operations. Fixed with `rm -f .beads/beads.*.jsonl .beads/beads.*.meta.json`\n- **Untracked JSONL files**: `bd doctor` warned about untracked `.beads/*.jsonl` files. Fixed by committing them to git.\n\n## Suggested Fix\nCheck if `.git` is a file (worktree) vs directory (regular repo) before attempting mkdir operations. Use `git rev-parse --git-dir` to get the actual git directory path.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-31T13:57:43.029789-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-31T13:57:59.374523-08:00","created_by":"agrande"}

When the player's buffer runs dry, it can cause clicks/pops as the audio stream stutters.\n\n## Investigation Areas\n\n### 1. Buffer Size Analysis\nCheck if AudioPlayer buffer is large enough:\n```python\nfrom mlx_audio.tts.audio_player import AudioPlayer\nimport inspect\n\n# Examine AudioPlayer implementation\nprint(inspect.getsource(AudioPlayer))\n```\n\nKey questions:\n- What's the default buffer size?\n- Is it configurable?\n- Does it auto-tune based on chunk delivery rate?\n\n### 2. Buffer State Monitoring\nAdd logging to monitor buffer fill level:\n```python\n# In mlx_tts_core.py streaming loop\nfor result in model.generate(...):\n    buffer_samples = player.buffered_samples()\n    print(f\"Buffer: {buffer_samples} samples ({buffer_samples/sample_rate*1000:.1f}ms)\")\n    player.queue_audio(audio_chunk)\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Buffer dropping to zero (underrun)\n- Large buffer fluctuations\n- Correlation between low buffer and crackles\n\n### 3. Timing Analysis\nCheck if chunk generation is fast enough:\n```python\nimport time\nfor result in model.generate(...):\n    now = time.perf_counter()\n    chunk_duration = len(result.audio) / sample_rate\n    time_since_last = now - last_time\n    \n    if time_since_last \u003e chunk_duration:\n        print(f\"WARNING: Generation slower than realtime! gap={time_since_last-chunk_duration:.3f}s\")\n    \n    last_time = now\n```\n\n### 4. AudioPlayer Source Review\nLocation of AudioPlayer in mlx_audio package:\n```bash\npython -c \"import mlx_audio.tts.audio_player as ap; print(ap.__file__)\"\n```\n\nReview for:\n- How it handles chunk concatenation internally\n- Buffer management strategy\n- Any known issues or TODOs\n\n## Potential Fixes (if buffer is the issue)\n\n### Option A: Increase buffer size\nIf AudioPlayer accepts buffer configuration, increase it.\n\n### Option B: Pre-buffer before starting\nWait for N chunks before starting playback:\n```python\nchunks_to_buffer = 3\nbuffered = []\nfor result in model.generate(...):\n    if len(buffered) \u003c chunks_to_buffer:\n        buffered.append(audio_processor(result.audio))\n    else:\n        if not player.playing:\n            for chunk in buffered:\n                player.queue_audio(chunk)\n            player.start_stream()\n        player.queue_audio(audio_processor(result.audio))\n```\n\n### Option C: Custom AudioPlayer\nIf mlx_audio's player is inflexible, implement custom using sounddevice or pyaudio.\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- `mlx_audio.tts.audio_player` - External package, read-only investigation\n- `scripts/mlx_tts_core.py` - Our usage of AudioPlayer\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Diagnostic: Log buffer levels during playback\n2. Diagnostic: Correlate buffer levels with audible crackles\n3. If fix identified: Before/after comparison\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Determine if buffer underrun is a contributing factor\n- If yes, implement fix that maintains low TTFT\n- Document AudioPlayer's behavior for future reference\n\n## Notes\n- This may reveal it's NOT a buffer issue, which is also valuable\n- Low RTF (\u003c 1.0) from our tests suggests generation is faster than realtime\n- But network/processing jitter could still cause momentary underruns","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:54:16.94948-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.882391-08:00","created_by":"agrande","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.882391-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
{"id":"mlx-tts-9po","title":"Experiment with different interpolation curve shapes","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nCurrent implementation uses a raised cosine (cos²) curve for interpolation correction. Different curve shapes may produce more natural-sounding transitions.\n\n## Current Implementation\n```python\n# Raised cosine: cos²(0 to π/2) = 1.0 to 0.0\ninterp_curve = np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi / 2, interp_samples, dtype=np.float32)) ** 2\n```\n\nThis provides smooth start (derivative=0 at boundary) but may not be optimal for audio.\n\n## Curves to Test\n\n### 1. Linear\n```python\n# Simple linear ramp from 1 to 0\ncurve = np.linspace(1, 0, n_samples)\n```\nPros: Simple, predictable\nCons: Discontinuous derivative at boundaries\n\n### 2. Exponential decay\n```python\n# Exponential: e^(-t/tau) where tau controls decay rate\nt = np.linspace(0, 5, n_samples)  # 5 time constants\ncurve = np.exp(-t)\ncurve = curve / curve[0]  # Normalize to start at 1\n```\nPros: Natural decay, commonly used in audio\nCons: Never truly reaches zero\n\n### 3. Gaussian\n```python\n# Gaussian: e^(-t²/2σ²)\nt = np.linspace(0, 3, n_samples)  # 3 sigma\ncurve = np.exp(-t**2 / 2)\n```\nPros: Very smooth, used in audio windowing\nCons: May be too gradual\n\n### 4. Hann window (half)\n```python\n# Half Hann window: 0.5 * (1 + cos(π * t))\nt = np.linspace(0, 1, n_samples)\ncurve = 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(np.pi * t))\n```\nPros: Standard in audio processing, smooth derivatives\nCons: Similar to current raised cosine\n\n### 5. Blackman-Harris (half)\n```python\n# Half Blackman-Harris - excellent sidelobe suppression\nt = np.linspace(0, 0.5, n_samples)\na0, a1, a2, a3 = 0.35875, 0.48829, 0.14128, 0.01168\ncurve = a0 - a1*np.cos(2*np.pi*t) + a2*np.cos(4*np.pi*t) - a3*np.cos(6*np.pi*t)\ncurve = curve / curve[0]  # Normalize\n```\nPros: Minimizes spectral artifacts\nCons: More complex\n\n### 6. S-curve (sigmoid)\n```python\n# Inverted sigmoid for smooth 1→0 transition\nt = np.linspace(-6, 6, n_samples)\ncurve = 1 - 1/(1 + np.exp(-t))\n```\nPros: Very smooth, equal derivatives at both ends\nCons: Might smear more audio than necessary\n\n## Testing Approach\n\nCreate parameterized test:\n```python\nCURVES = {\n    \"raised_cosine\": lambda n: np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, n))**2,\n    \"linear\": lambda n: np.linspace(1, 0, n),\n    \"exponential\": lambda n: np.exp(-np.linspace(0, 5, n)),\n    \"hann\": lambda n: 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(np.pi * np.linspace(0, 1, n))),\n    # ... etc\n}\n\nfor name, curve_fn in CURVES.items():\n    # Generate speech with this curve\n    # Listen and rate quality\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Make curve configurable or test variations\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Unit test: Each curve function produces valid 1→0 transition\n2. Unit test: Curve lengths match expected samples\n3. Visual test: Plot all curves for comparison\n4. Listening test: A/B comparison with same test text\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Identify if any curve shape significantly outperforms raised cosine\n- Document findings for future reference\n- If better curve found, update default\n\n## Notes\n- Differences may be subtle - use consistent test text\n- Consider testing at multiple window sizes (20ms, 50ms)\n- The \"best\" curve may depend on window size","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:55:14.254263-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.883629-08:00","created_by":"agrande","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.883629-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

Use the TDD orchestrator skill to guide red-green-refactor cycles.\n\n### How to Execute\n1. Start with: `/tdd-workflows:tdd-orchestrator`\n2. Follow the red-green-refactor discipline the skill enforces\n3. Never write implementation before failing tests\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Phases (TDD Approach)\n\n### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure\n**🔴 Red Phase** - Write failing tests first\n1. Create `tests/test_mlx_tts.py` with pytest fixtures\n2. Write tests for model loading (mock mlx_audio imports)\n3. Write tests for audio generation with preloaded model\n4. Write tests for play=True behavior\n5. Run tests - all should FAIL (no implementation yet)\n\n### Phase 2: Core API Integration  \n**🟢 Green Phase** - Minimal implementation to pass tests\n1. Create `mlx_tts_core.py` module with:\n   - `load_tts_model()` - wraps load_model with error handling\n   - `generate_speech()` - wraps generate_audio with our defaults\n2. Update `tts-notify.py` to import and use new module\n3. Run tests - all should PASS\n\n### Phase 3: Refactor \u0026 Optimize\n**🔵 Refactor Phase** - Clean up without breaking tests\n1. Add model caching at module level\n2. Add lazy loading with `@functools.lru_cache`\n3. Add timeout handling for generation\n4. Run tests - all should still PASS\n\n## Key Code Changes\n\n**Before (subprocess):**\n```python\nsubprocess.run([\n    sys.executable, \"-m\", \"mlx_audio.tts.generate\",\n    \"--model\", MLX_MODEL,\n    \"--text\", message,\n    ...\n])\n```\n\n**After (direct API):**\n```python\nfrom mlx_audio.tts.utils import load_model\nfrom mlx_audio.tts.generate import generate_audio\n\n_model = None\n\ndef get_model():\n    global _model\n    if _model is None:\n        _model = load_model(\"mlx-community/chatterbox-turbo-fp16\")\n    return _model\n\ndef speak_mlx(message: str):\n    generate_audio(\n        text=message,\n        model=get_model(),\n        ref_audio=MLX_VOICE_REF,\n        ref_text=\".\",\n        speed=MLX_SPEED,\n        play=True,\n        verbose=False,\n    )\n```\n\n## Test Cases\n\n### Unit Tests\n```python\ndef test_load_tts_model_returns_valid_model():\n    model = load_tts_model()\n    assert hasattr(model, 'sample_rate')\n\ndef test_generate_speech_with_preloaded_model():\n    model = load_tts_model()\n    # Should not raise, should play audio\n    generate_speech(\"Test\", model=model, play=True)\n\ndef test_model_reuse_no_reload():\n    m1 = get_model()\n    m2 = get_model()\n    assert m1 is m2  # Same instance\n```\n\n### Integration Tests  \n```python\ndef test_warm_latency_under_1_second():\n    model = get_model()  # Cold load\n    start = time.time()\n    generate_speech(\"Quick test\", model=model, play=False)\n    assert time.time() - start \u003c 1.0\n```\n\n## Success Metrics\n- [ ] All unit tests pass\n- [ ] Warm latency \u003c1s\n- [ ] No subprocess calls for MLX TTS\n- [ ] Graceful fallback to macOS say on failure\n\n## Blocked By\n- mlx-tts-sqn (Research) ✅ COMPLETE","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-24T15:51:53.806082-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T16:51:18.190151-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-24T16:51:18.190151-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mlx-tts-dno","depends_on_id":"mlx-tts-sqn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-24T15:52:10.187281-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"mlx-tts-at6","title":"Add DC offset removal / high-pass filter at chunk boundaries","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nSome chunk boundary discontinuities may be caused by DC offset drift between chunks. A high-pass filter or DC blocker can remove low-frequency components that cause baseline shifts.\n\n## Technical Background\n\nDC offset in audio appears as the waveform not being centered around zero. If different chunks have different DC offsets, stitching them creates a step discontinuity.\n\n### DC Blocker Formula\nSimple first-order high-pass filter:\n```python\ny[n] = x[n] - x[n-1] + R * y[n-1]\n\nwhere R = 0.995 to 0.999 (controls cutoff frequency)\n```\n\nThis removes frequencies below ~20Hz while preserving speech.\n\n### Implementation Options\n\n**Option A: Per-chunk DC removal**\n```python\ndef remove_dc(audio):\n    \"\"\"Remove DC offset from audio chunk.\"\"\"\n    return audio - np.mean(audio)\n```\nSimple but doesn't account for running DC offset.\n\n**Option B: Streaming DC blocker**\n```python\ndef create_dc_blocker(R=0.998):\n    state = {\"x_prev\": 0.0, \"y_prev\": 0.0}\n    \n    def process(audio):\n        output = np.zeros_like(audio)\n        x_prev = state[\"x_prev\"]\n        y_prev = state[\"y_prev\"]\n        \n        for i, x in enumerate(audio):\n            y = x - x_prev + R * y_prev\n            output[i] = y\n            x_prev = x\n            y_prev = y\n        \n        state[\"x_prev\"] = x_prev\n        state[\"y_prev\"] = y_prev\n        return output\n    \n    return process\n```\n\n**Option C: Chunk boundary DC matching**\n```python\ndef match_dc_at_boundary(prev_chunk, curr_chunk):\n    \"\"\"Adjust curr_chunk's DC to match prev_chunk's ending DC.\"\"\"\n    # Estimate DC at end of previous chunk\n    prev_dc = np.mean(prev_chunk[-100:])\n    \n    # Estimate DC at start of current chunk\n    curr_dc = np.mean(curr_chunk[:100])\n    \n    # Shift current chunk to match\n    return curr_chunk - (curr_dc - prev_dc)\n```\n\n## Integration Point\nIn `audio_processor.py`, add DC processing BEFORE interpolation:\n1. Remove/match DC offset\n2. Apply interpolation correction\n3. Apply compressor/limiter\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Add DC blocker to processing chain\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Unit test: Verify DC blocker removes DC offset\n2. Unit test: Verify speech frequencies are preserved (\u003e80Hz)\n3. Diagnostic: Measure DC offset at chunk boundaries in real audio\n4.

{"id":"mlx-tts-6ye","title":"Implement true end-to-end HTTP streaming for TTS client","description":"## Problem\n\nThe HTTP TTS client path does NOT actually stream audio - it buffers the entire response before playback begins.\n\n### Current Architecture (Broken Streaming)\n\n**Server side** (works correctly):\n- `tts_server.py:157` yields chunks via generator\n- Chunks generated every ~0.5s (configurable via `tts_config.py:11`)\n- Server returns StreamingResponse with chunked transfer encoding\n\n**Client side** (the bottleneck):\n```python\n# mlx_server_utils.py:254,262\nresponse = requests.post(url, json=payload, timeout=timeout)\naudio_data = response.content  # ← BLOCKS until entire response received!\n```\n\nThen plays from buffer:\n```python\n# mlx_server_utils.py:303-304\nsd.play(data, samplerate)  # Plays entire buffer, not streaming\nsd.wait()\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n- User waits for FULL generation time before hearing anything\n- TTFT for HTTP path: ~2.5s+ (full generation)\n- TTFT for Direct API path: ~260ms (true streaming)\n- HTTP path wastes the streaming capability the server provides\n\n### Solution\n\n1. Use `requests.post(..., stream=True)` to get chunked response iterator\n2. Parse WAV chunks as they arrive (handle WAV header separately)\n3. Use `AudioPlayer.queue_audio()` pattern (already proven in mlx_tts_core.py:303)\n4. Maintain stateful audio compression across chunks (audio_processor.py pattern)\n\n### Key Files to Modify\n\n| File | Current | Target |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| mlx_server_utils.py:254 | `requests.post()` | `requests.post(..., stream=True)` |\n| mlx_server_utils.py:262 | `response.content` | `response.iter_content()` loop |\n| mlx_server_utils.py:303 | `sd.play(data)` | `AudioPlayer.queue_audio()` |\n\n### Implementation Mandate\n\n**All implementation tasks MUST use `/tdd-cycle` workflow**:\n1. Write failing test first\n2. Implement minimal code to pass\n3. Refactor while tests pass\n4. Repeat\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] HTTP client streams audio chunks as they arrive\n- [ ] TTFT for HTTP path reduced to \u003c500ms (from ~2.5s)\n- [ ] Audio quality identical to current buffered approach\n- [ ] Compression artifacts avoided at chunk boundaries\n- [ ] All tests pass with \u003e90% coverage on new code","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-28T11:12:01.861498-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T12:12:35.988589-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T12:12:35.988589-08:00","created_by":"agrande"}

{"id":"mlx-tts-7qw","title":"Implement adaptive interpolation window based on discontinuity magnitude","description":"## Parent Epic\nmlx-tts-e95: Fix streaming mode audio quality\n\n## Overview\nInstead of a fixed interpolation window, dynamically size the window based on how large the discontinuity is. Large jumps need more samples to smooth out; small jumps can use fewer.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\nCurrent approach uses fixed 20ms window regardless of discontinuity size:\n- 3% jump and 0.1% jump get same treatment\n- Small jumps may not need correction at all (wasted processing)\n- Large jumps may need longer correction window\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n```python\ndef calculate_adaptive_window(discontinuity, sample_rate, base_ms=20.0, max_ms=100.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scale window size based on discontinuity magnitude.\n    \n    Args:\n        discontinuity: Absolute difference between prev_last and curr_first\n        sample_rate: Audio sample rate\n        base_ms: Minimum window size\n        max_ms: Maximum window size\n    \"\"\"\n    # Discontinuity thresholds (percentage of full scale)\n    SMALL_DISC = 0.01   # 1% - minimal correction needed\n    LARGE_DISC = 0.05   # 5% - full correction window\n    \n    disc_abs = abs(discontinuity)\n    \n    if disc_abs \u003c SMALL_DISC:\n        # Small discontinuity - minimal or no correction\n        return int(sample_rate * base_ms / 1000)\n    elif disc_abs \u003e= LARGE_DISC:\n        # Large discontinuity - maximum window\n        return int(sample_rate * max_ms / 1000)\n    else:\n        # Linear interpolation between base and max\n        ratio = (disc_abs - SMALL_DISC) / (LARGE_DISC - SMALL_DISC)\n        ms = base_ms + ratio * (max_ms - base_ms)\n        return int(sample_rate * ms / 1000)\n```\n\n### Integration Point\nIn `audio_processor.py`, replace fixed `interp_samples` with dynamic calculation:\n```python\n# Before (current)\ninterp_samples = max(4, int(sample_rate * INTERP_MS / 1000))\n\n# After (adaptive)\ndisc = audio_f32[0] - state[\"prev_last\"]\ninterp_samples = calculate_adaptive_window(disc, sample_rate)\ninterp_curve = generate_curve(interp_samples)  # May need to cache common sizes\n```\n\n### Performance Consideration\nGenerating new curves for each chunk is expensive. Solution:\n- Pre-compute curves for common sizes (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100ms)\n- Round to nearest pre-computed size\n- Or use a formula that doesn't require pre-computation\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Add adaptive window logic\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1.

This task explores modifying BOTH ends - also adjusting the END of each chunk to better connect to the next.\n\n## Technical Background\n\nCurrent approach (unidirectional):\n```\nChunk N:   [.......prev_last]\nChunk N+1: [curr_first.......]\n            ↑ Only this is modified to approach prev_last\n```\n\nBidirectional approach:\n```\nChunk N:   [.......prev_last]  ← Also modify to approach predicted next value\nChunk N+1: [curr_first.......]  ← Modify to approach prev_last\n```\n\n## Implementation Challenge\n\nWe don't know `curr_first` of the next chunk until we receive it. Solutions:\n\n### Option A: One-chunk delay buffer\n- Buffer each chunk\n- When next chunk arrives, modify end of buffered chunk based on next chunk's start\n- Output the modified buffered chunk\n- Trade-off: Adds ~0.5s latency\n\n### Option B: Predictive fade\n- Fade the last N samples of each chunk toward zero or toward running average\n- Less accurate but no added latency\n```python\n# Fade end of chunk toward predicted continuation\nfade_samples = 32\nfade_curve = np.linspace(1.0, 0.8, fade_samples)  # Partial fade\naudio_f32[-fade_samples:] *= fade_curve\n```\n\n### Option C: Symmetric interpolation (both ends fade to/from midpoint)\n- Start of chunk: interpolate from prev_last to actual value\n- End of chunk: interpolate from actual value toward running average\n- Both use symmetric window functions\n\n## Implementation Location\n`scripts/audio_processor.py` in `create_processor()` function\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `scripts/audio_processor.py` - Add end-of-chunk processing\n\n## Testing Requirements\n**MANDATORY: Use `/tdd-cycle` skill**\n\nTest cases:\n1. Unit test: Verify end-of-chunk modification is applied correctly\n2. Unit test: Verify chunk delay (if using Option A) maintains sample accuracy\n3. Integration test: Compare A/B with current unidirectional approach\n4. Latency measurement: Ensure TTFT impact is acceptable\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Improved audio quality over unidirectional approach\n- If using buffer approach, latency increase documented and acceptable\n- No audio artifacts introduced by end-of-chunk modification\n\n## Notes\n- This could be combined with start-of-chunk interpolation\n- Consider testing with and without start interpolation to isolate effect","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T18:52:29.657358-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.880708-08:00","created_by":"agrande","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T18:56:28.880708-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
